            <p>
              I am Mohamed Ayoub doing my Ph.D. (by initially pursuing an M.Phil) in Computer Science in the Department of Computer Science at the 
              University of Nottingham on a scholarship from the Faculty of Science.
              <br>
              <br>
              Although I started out as a student in software engieering in 2016, since 2021 my focus has been on reducing 
              the carbon footprint of the planet using machine learning, and using computer science researches on agriculture 
              to solve the food crisis. For the past couple of years, I have been fixated learning more about the biodiversity 
              potential of forests, looking at both conservation and restoration.

            <p>Emergence refers to the existence or formation of collective behaviors — what parts of a system do together

                <li>
                  <p>For example, cells that make up a muscle display the emergent property of

                  the cell, and it is an end product of the processes of photophosphorylation (adding a phosphate group to a molecule 
                  using energy from light), cellular respiration, and fermentation.</p>

                Nano visualization poses several new technological challenges that are not reflected in the state of the art computer graphics and 3D visualization as of today. The underlying domain requires new techniques for multi-scale, multi-instance, dense, three-dimensional models which were never subject to technological advances in 3D graphics before. 
<br>
Research carried out in nano visualization were to thoroughly revisit all technological aspects of rendering, visualization, navigation, user interaction, and modeling in order to offer an algorithmic solution that addresses visualization associated with the nano and microscopic scales. In-house custom algorithms were developed to segment multiple instances of cellular objects under the supervision of Dr.Ciril Bohak and Prof. Ivan Viola. We developed 3D models based on the volumetric data using the marching cubes algorithm. We visualized the nanostructures in a phong liquid environment. The final artifact of the research was a process to convert instance based meshes from volumetric tensor using Python, Javascript was used to ingress the 3D models in a liquid environment and navigate. This process of instance extraction was 400-500% percent faster than entire volumetric data and less than 10% in size.

              <b>Manifold Learning of Latent Space Vectors in Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Synthesis.</b>

              <p>
                Generative Adversarial Networks have attained remarkable results in image augmentation and generation. GAN models consist of Latent space vectors. Mathematically they are a hypersphere consisting of many dimensions, containing the learnt representation. However, various GAN variants use different techniques to model latent space vectors. 
                <br>
                My dissertation dissects the latent space vectors of state-of-the-arts GAN variants, for image synthesis. We also compare and contrast optimization methods of latent space vectors in existing literature. In this dissertation, we undertake a comparative analysis of latent space vectors and optimization methods of the popular image synthesizing GAN models. Based on a review of mathematical methods we choose manifold learning techniques to cluster the latent space. Results of clustering allowed us to determine the sparse and dense features of Euclidean image distribution. The research on the image augmentation techniques allowed the authors to make a deployable facial recognition system utilizing advanced image models. We reviewed existing work on face recognition such as the FaceNet model to make the system. We further used concurrent programming principles to optimize the model to train 40% faster than the FaceNet network.
